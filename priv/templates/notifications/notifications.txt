Hey,

Something's changed in the scraped apartments, and I thought you might want to know.

Here's the latest:
<%= for k <- Dict.keys(assigns) do %> <% {a, reason} = Dict.get(assigns, k) %>
  Unit: <%= a.unit %>
  Beds: <%= a.beds %>  Baths: <%= a.baths %>
  Sq Ft: <%= a.sqft %>
  Rent: $<%= Float.to_string a.rent, decimals: 2 %>
  <%= if reason do %> **Reason**: <%= reason %> <% end %>
<% end %>

Have a good day!
